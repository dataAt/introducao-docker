abstract = {Virtualization technology plays a vital role in cloud computing. In particular, benefits of virtualization are widely employed in high performance computing (HPC) applications. Recently, virtual machines (VMs) and Docker containers known as two virtualization platforms need to be explored for developing applications efficiently. We target a model for deploying distributed applications on Docker containers, among using well-known benchmarks to evaluate performance between VMs and containers. Based on their architecture, we propose benchmark scenarios to analyze the computing performance and the ability of data access on HPC system. Remarkably, Docker container has more advantages than virtual machine in terms of data intensive application and computing ability, especially the overhead of Docker is trivial. However, Docker architecture has some drawbacks in resource management. Our experiment and evaluation show how to deploy efficiently high performance computing applications on Docker containers and VMs.{\textless}br/{\textgreater} {\&}copy; 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Hypervisors, popularized by Xen and VMware, are quickly becoming commodity. They are appropriate for many us- age scenarios, but there are scenarios that require system virtualization with high degrees of both isolation and effi- ciency. Examples include HPC clusters, the Grid, hosting centers, and PlanetLab. We present an alternative to hy- pervisors that is better suited to such scenarios. The ap- proach is a synthesis of prior work on resource containers and security containers applied to general-purpose, time- shared operating systems. Examples of such container-based systems include Solaris 10, Virtuozzo for Linux, and Linux- VServer. As a representative instance of container-based systems, this paper describes the design and implementa- tion of Linux-VServer. In addition, it contrasts the archi- tecture of Linux-VServer with current generations of Xen, and shows how Linux-VServer provides comparable support for isolation and superior system efficienc},

abstract = {Virtualization of operating systems provides a common way to run different services in the cloud. Recently, the lightweight virtualization technologies claim to offer superior performance. In this paper, we present a detailed performance comparison of traditional hypervisor based virtualization and new lightweight solutions. In our measurements, we use several benchmarks tools in order to understand the strengths, weaknesses, and anomalies introduced by these different platforms in terms of processing, storage, memory and network. Our results show that containers achieve generally better performance when compared with traditional virtual machines and other recent solutions. Albeit containers offer clearly more dense deployment of virtual machines, the performance difference with other technologies is in many cases relatively small.},
